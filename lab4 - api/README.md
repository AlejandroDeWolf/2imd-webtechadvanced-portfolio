## Hello Fresh ad with api
For this assignment I made a little ad for Hello Fresh. With the help of an api the current weather gets fetched. Then with the help of a second api the ad will recommend you a certain recipe or dish based on the weather. If it's below 15 degrees Celcius, the api will show a recipe with more than 10g of fat (a heavier dish). On the other hand, when it's more than 15 degrees Celcius outside, it will show a recipe with less than 10g of fat (a light dish).
